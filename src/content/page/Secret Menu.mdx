## FAQ
<Accordion>
	  <AccordionItem
	      title="Why get a cleansing?"
    >
	    Cleanings banish unseen influences that negatively impact your ability to live well and achieve your goals. Whether we realize it or not, each interaction we have with people, places, and spirits marks us in positive and negative ways. When negative energetic influence builds, we often experience more bad luck and blockages than we are used to. Clearing out any influences that are working against us can help us recover and improve the trajectory of our lives, or our feelings within a space. 
    
	    Cleansings also release us from relational bonds which negatively impact our well-being. The bonds we form in the course of getting close to someone do not disappear when that person leaves our lives, our energies continue to be entangled until that connection is intentionally severed. This is especially problematic when someone has had an abusive or toxic connection in the past where the other person took a lot of energy and left them drained. The influence of that bond can continue to drain your energy or negatively impact you in other ways, so its important to be able to cut off that influence.

	    title="Why hire a professional?"
	>				
		Like any other professional, ritual specialists have the skills, tools, and knowledge to help clients get the results they want. Anyone can wave some sage around and feel a bit better, but effective magical work takes years of practice, learning, and relationship building with supportive spirits. It is very difficult to get lasting results without that skill-set and support.
	
		I have been practicing magic for more than 5 years, and have long since lost count of all the cleansings and other work I've done.

	  <AccordionItem
	    title="Can I get a personal cleansing without cleansing my space?"
  >	
	       Cleansing yourself without cleansing your space is a lot like getting out of the shower and getting into dirty sheets -- you don't stay clean for long. 
	       
	       A space that has not been thoroughly cleansed is marked by the influence of everything that has happened there. This energetic build-up can make it difficult to feel at ease in a space, or even negatively influence a person's mental health, and reinforce negative cycles of thinking and acting. Negative energetic build-ups can also attract parasitic spirits that feed on that negative energy, and will actively try to make a situation worse.
	
		Cleansings wipe the slate clean so that we can build supportive and healthy homes, projects, and businesses.
