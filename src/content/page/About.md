## About
#### About me
My name is Snorri (they/she)! I'm a queer writer and astrologer located on unceded Kanien'kehá:ka land, in Tioh'tià:ke / Mooniyang / Montréal, QC. My research focuses on the interdependence of individual and collective well-being, and aims at helping us flourish as we work towards realizing a more just future. I believe that astrology is a powerful toolkit for making sense of the world and reinforcing our sense of agency within it! In session, I help clients realize how their unique strengths can be used to overcome the challenges they face, and how they can step fully into their power. In this way I hope to support the flourishing of my clients and all their relations within the human and more-than-human world.

My work emerges from years of ritual practice and engaged study across multiple disciplines. The need to make meaning within my own life lead me to dig deeply into various branches of philosophy, psychology, gender studies, political theory, and political analysis -- all of which inform my approach to astrology. I also became deeply engaged with spiritual practice, which has lead me to cultivate direct relationships with each of the planetary spirits, deepening my theoretical knowledge of astrology with practical experience. I hold a BA in psychology and a BA in honours philosophy from Concordia University, and continue to pursue my research independently. 

#### My practice
Sessions with me are a collaborative process of meaning making. This means that I don't have all the answers -- you are the best authority on your own life! My job is to work with you to find what resonates with your experience and supports your self-understanding, keeping what is helpful and discarding what isn't. Your interpretation matters most, and I encourage you to let me know when you disagree with one of my interpretations or have a different interpretation. The dialogue that shapes a reading is often the most rewarding part, so trust yourself first and foremost! (◡‿◡✿)

My lineage is mostly based in [Ancient Hellenistic](https://www.hellenisticastrology.com/) astrology, especially the work of [Chris Brennan](https://www.chrisbrennanastrologer.com/). This means your chart may be different from services that focus on modern systems, such as Co-Star. I have found that Hellenistic systems and techniques$^1$ provide more accurate and comprehensive readings, especially for dividing the life into thematic chapters and assessing planetary influence. I am also deeply indebted to the writing of [Alice Sparkly Kat](https://www.alicesparklykat.com/postcolonialastrology/), and aspire for my astrology to work in service of those struggling for liberatory futures.

$^1$ My readings use the whole sign house system, the tropical zodiac, and a mix of traditional and modern house significations. I also make heavy use of zodiacal releasing, annual profections, and the master of the nativity. 
#### Professional Boundaries
- Sessions are most effective when clients provide context about their life, which often includes discussing important events or experiences that the reading brings to mind. However, there is no pressure to disclose any personal information, especially if something would be uncomfortable or upsetting to discuss. 
  
- Sometimes, clients find that a reading can bring to mind events or experiences which are deeply personal or traumatic. Sharing how the event relates to your chart can be an important part of the meaning making process, but discussion should focus on the reading and not the details of the experience. I am not a trained therapist and unpacking difficult experiences can very easily derail a reading, preventing you from getting the most out of your session. 
  
  If a difficult experience becomes relevant to the reading, focus on briefly explaining what happened and the impact it had on you. For example, imagine a client notices that a chapter in their life we are examining lines up with an experience of domestic abuse. An appropriate way to discuss it might be: "At that time in my life I was in an abusive relationship, and it affected me very deeply. I was isolated from most of my support network and it really damaged my self-esteem. I'm still recovering from those experiences and figuring out how to move forward."
  
- I am committed to client confidentiality and will not disclose personal details or identifiable information to other people or organizations. I keep a private record of your chart and any notes prepared before or during our session; these will be forwarded to you in the follow-up email after your session. If part of your chart is particularly interesting or insightful I may ask whether you are comfortable with me sharing the relevant part of your chart in lessons, workshops or discussions. If you consent, your identity, personal details, and anything else you would prefer to not be shared will remain private. 
  
- Please respect my time and let me know if you can't make your appointment! I require 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling, and charge half of my standard rate for missed appointments.
  
- Though it is rare, I reserve the right to refuse service to a client for any reason I deem appropriate. Please treat me with the respect and consideration that we both deserve <3
