##### FAQ
- *Are your readings online or in-person?* 
  Both! I do online readings over zoom and usually do in-person readings in a cafe, park, or private residence. If you book an in-person reading, I will follow up with you to determine a location or let you know if I'm only available online.
- *What if I don't know anything about astrology?*
  I tailor each reading to your level of experience to make sure the information is accessible and useful. I also encourage clients to ask for clarifications when something needs to be re-explained, and I check in through the session to make sure I've communicated well.
- *Can I bring a friend?*
  You can bring a friend to your reading so long as they are quiet and let the reading naturally unfold. I may ask your friend to leave if I feel they are being disruptive, or if I think the reading would go more smoothly without them present. 
- *What if I need to cancel?*
  Please respect my time and let me know if you can't make your appointment! I require 24 hours notice for cancellations or rescheduling, and charge half of my standard rate for missed appointments.
