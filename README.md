## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚	â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚   		â””â”€â”€ Image files live here
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚	â””â”€â”€ components/
â”‚	â””â”€â”€ content/
â”‚   	â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   		â””â”€â”€ Article .md files live here
â”‚   	â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   		â””â”€â”€ .md files for other pages live here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ layouts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
